# Testing

## Bugs Found

1. **Profile Element Being Pushed To Left On Large Screens** - *Fix:* Testing showed that the *navbar-expand-lg* bootstrap class was changing the navbar elements to flex on large screens which messed up the profile position. Removing the class fixed the issue.
2. **DataTables Not Resizing Correctly** - *Fix:* Remove *class="col"* attributes from *th* elements in datatables.
3. **Cards Stacking On Top Due To Height Constraint** - *Fix:* Add margin bottom and use calc function to calculate height instead.
4. **Steps Up and Down Buttons Not Behaving Properly On Row Delete** - *Fix:* TBC
5. **Steps Up and Down Buttons Not Being Disabled On Edit Page** - *Fix:* This was due to the fact that the rows were generated by django, not the js script so the script to disable the appropriate buttons wasn't running. I created a document ready function that performed the action again.
6. **Some Users Not Able to Create Jobs** - *Fix:* TBC
7. **Extending User Model To Include Custom Fields Not Saving Correctly** - *Fix:* Create custom save method on the custom all-auth signup form to process fields and create an instance of the *UserProfile* model
8. **Circular Import In Assets Models File Due To Interdependancy of Models** - *Fix:* The *Job* model has a foreign key to the *Assets* model, the *PPM* model has a foreign key relationship to the *Assets* and *Jobs* models. Having the *Assets* model and *PPM* models in the same *models.py* file was giving a circular import due to the relationships between the models. As such I had to segregate the models into two seperate files in the *submodels* directory to prevent the circular import error.
9. **Tables overflowing horizontally in details pages on mobile views** - *Fix:* Add *table-responsive-sm* class to tables
10. **Not Able To Accurately Record Which Jobs Are PPM's** - *Fix:* Change PPM model structure to be a job template.
11. **Repetitive Templating** - *Fix:* Create base templates for different template structures
12. **Unnecessary POST Handlers** - *Fix:* Some views call an instance of a form just to set an initial parameter but get passed to a different view as the POST form handler, as such, having POST handlers on the initial views was unneccessary
13. **No Margin Beneath Buttons On Details Pages** - *Fix:* Add bottom padding to main element
14. **Allowed To Withdraw Stock When Not Enough Available** - *Fix:* Add custom clean method to transfers form to check the current stock before validating the form.
15. **int object has no attribute microseconds** - *Fix:* When creating a new project I ran an error that was trying to get the attribute microseconds of an integer. I discovered that in one of my aggregate functions, I was trying to find the average time. If no times are recorded then it is treated as zero. I then wanted to take the microseconds attribute off the average time which is what caused the error. I added a check to see if the average time was a time delta object before the operation is performed.

## Outstanding Bugs

### Datatables Not Resizing Correctly On Screen Resize

[Datatables](https://datatables.net/) is a JS/CSS api for creating datatables with responsive resizing, search functionalities, ordering buttons, pagination and many other features. It is an excellent library. However, a bug I found when using it was that the datatable underwent a large screen resize, the responsiveness of the datatables would break and cause the table to overflow out of it's divider or not fill it's container completely. Upon refreshing the page at the current screen width, the datatables behave as expected. You can see examples of what I mean below.

#### Normal Behaviour

#### Not Filling Div On Screen Resize - Small To Big

![Broken Datatable Small](images/datatable-small-broken.png)

#### Overflowing Div On Screen Resize - Big To Small

![Broken Datatable Big](images/datatable-big-broken.png)

I struggled to find a solution to fix this problem. Adding CSS style rules to the table/container accomplished nothing as the *Datatables* library overrides them. I scoured the datatables documentation for fixes but came up empty. I tried the following datatables functions, [responsive.recalc()](https://datatables.net/reference/api/responsive.recalc()) and [columns.adjust()](https://datatables.net/reference/api/columns.adjust()) but neither of them fixed the problem.

One thing that did work was using a JS script to automatically refresh the page on screen resize however after discussing this fix with my mentor he suggested removing this as it was bad UX design to force a page reload on a screen resize. We worked together to try and find a solution to the issue but came up short and decided that screen resizes are not natural browser behaviours and that as long as it was responsive on mobile and desktop when the page is initially loaded then it is responsive. I agreed and removed it and decided instead to document the bug in the documentation as proof of my attempts to fix the issue.

To be clear, the tables are responsive on all screen sizes and the tables resize correctly on small resizes, mobile portrait to mobile landscape for example, however on some large screen resizes the datatables may not behave properly by either not filling their div or overflowing it. This can be amended by a page reload.

## Lighthouse Testing

Using the *Chrome Dev Tools*, I generated lighthouse reports for different sections of the site to evaluate responsiveness, performance and find any issues the site may have. The Lighthouse testing was conducted on the [deployed](https://meade-pallas.herokuapp.com/) version of the site.

### Home Page

![Home - Lighthouse](images/home-lighthouse.png)

**SEO: Site Didn't Have *Meta* Description** - *Fix:* Add *Meta* description to base template header.

### Dashboard Page

![Dashboard - Lighthouse](images/dashboard-lighthouse.png)

**Performance: Eliminate render-blocking resoures** - The biggest issue holding the back was the loading of the external Bootstrap files which I couldn't really do anything about because they are needed by the site so I couldn't fix it.

### Jobs Page

### Job Details Page

### Create Job Form Page

### Notifications Page

![Notifications - Lighthouse](images/notifications-lighthouse.png)

**Bug: Table Not Responsive On Small Screens**  - *Fix:* Not Lighthouse specific but I noticed the notifications table slighthly overflowed on very small screens. I added table responsive sm class to table

### Staff Detail Page

### Project Details Page

### Sign Up Form

![Sign Up Form - Lighthouse](images/signup-form-lighthouse.png)

I was pretty happy with the lighthouse results, there were only minor issues on most of the pages with easy fixes and I was satisfied that the scores were all high enough.

## Manual Testing

Manual testing was conducted to verify that all features, functionalities, buttons and forms performed the intended actions without any major problems or internal server errors.

### Sign Up Form Testing

#### Sign Up Test Procedure

1. Navigate to sign up form
2. Fill in form details using temporary email address from [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/en/). Try using invalid responses to check that form doesn't allow blank fields
3. Submit form
4. Check temporary mailbox for verification email
5. Click link in email to verify account
6. Sign in with account to verify the account is working properly

![Sign Up Form Test](images/signup-form-test.png)

#### Sign Up Test Outcome

Using an invalid email address for the email field wouldn't let me submit it as intended.

![Email Input Test](images/email-input-test.png)

Trying to sign up with a username that already exists also failed as should be the case.

![Duplicate User Test](images/duplicate-user-test.png)

Trying to create an account with too simple a password like *abc123* failed too which is appropriate.

![Password Test](images/password-test.png)

Upon submitting a valid form, the site notifies the user to verify their email address.

![Verify Email](images/verify-email-test.png)

The email was sent successfully, however, I did notice that the email contained an invalid link to the site of *pallas.example.com*.

**Fix:** I logged into the admin center and changed the site entry to *meade-pallas.herokuapp.com* to fix this.

![Email Test](images/email-test.png)

Upon clicking the verification link, I was prompted to confirm my email as expected.

![Confirm Email Test](images/confirm-email-test.png)

After confirming the account, I was able to login as expected.

All mobile navigation behaved as intended.

**Fix:** While testing the mobile navigation I noticed a few of the tables, forms had headings that didn't line up with what they were showing. I amended those as appropriate.
