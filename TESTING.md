## Bugs Found

1. **Profile Element Being Pushed To Left On Large Screens** - *Fix:* Testing showed that the *navbar-expand-lg* bootstrap class was changing the navbar elements to flex on large screens which messed up the profile position. Removing the class fixed the issue.
2. **DataTables Not Resizing Correctly** - *Fix:* TBC
3. **Cards Stacking On Top Due To Height Constraint** - *Fix:* Add margin bottom and use calc function to calculate height instead.
4. **Steps Up and Down Buttons Not Behaving Properly On Row Delete** - *Fix:* TBC
5. **Steps Up and Down Buttons Not Being Disabled On Edit Page** - *Fix:* This was due to the fact that the rows were generated by django, not the js script so the script to disable the appropriate buttons wasn't running. I created a document ready function that performed the action again.
6. **Some Users Not Able to Create Jobs** - *Fix:* TBC
